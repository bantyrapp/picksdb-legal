    <h2>5. Payments & Stripe</h2>
    <p>How payments are processed securely:</p>
    <p>Payments are processed by Stripe. We do not store full payment card numbers or full bank details on our servers. Stripe acts as a payment processor/PISP and may process personal data under its own terms and privacy policy. We receive limited status information (e.g., subscription status, payout state) to operate features.</p>

    <h2>6. Community Safety & Moderation</h2>
    <p>How we process data to keep Picksdb safe:</p>
    <p>To enforce policies and keep the platform safe, we collect and process:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Human moderators review automated flags. We may monitor, review, and store communications (including private messages) for safety, moderation, legal compliance, and to prevent abuse. We log policy actions and preserve relevant data for dispute handling, legal obligations, and safety. We retain moderation data and communications data as long as necessary for safety and legal compliance, typically up to 12 months after account closure. We may share communications data with law enforcement when required by law or to protect safety.</p>

    <h2>7. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>What we avoid storing:</p>
    <p>We do not store full payment card numbers, full bank account details, government ID numbers (except as necessary for creator onboarding via payment partners), or biometric data. If future features require sensitive data, we will provide clear notice and obtain appropriate consent.</p>

    <p><strong>Picksdb is NOT directed to children under 18. We do NOT knowingly collect personal information from users under 18.</strong> We require users to be 18+ to create accounts. If we discover that we have collected data from a minor, we will delete it immediately and terminate the account.</p>
    <p>We apply age restrictions (18+) and may use coarse location (e.g., region/country) to comply with applicable laws and to disable features that could be construed as wagering. We do not provide a sportsbook or prize contests. We may adjust features by jurisdiction where required.</p>

    <p>Cross‑border processing and safeguards:</p>
    <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where applicable, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as contractual clauses) for cross‑border transfers.</p>

    <h2>11. Creators & Payments</h2>
    <p>Third‑party onboarding, payouts, and tax information:</p>
    <p>If you enable creator features and payouts, payment onboarding (including bank account and identity verification) is handled by our third‑party payment partner.

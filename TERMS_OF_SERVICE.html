    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: January 27, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Picksdb is a content creator platform for entertainment purposes only. This is NOT a gambling product, sports betting service, or any service that pays out winnings or facilitates actual betting.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Purpose & Nature of Service</h2>
    <p>Picksdb is a subscription-based content creator platform where users can subscribe to creators to access their picks, predictions, and insights about MMA and other combat sports matchups for entertainment purposes only. Creators can monetize their picks and insights by charging subscribers a monthly subscription fee. The platform charges a 2% fee on subscriptions (Stripe charges 3%, total 5% fee) and a $0.25 withdrawal fee when creators withdraw earnings (Stripe also charges $0.25, total $0.50 per withdrawal). The platform may display odds information and hypothetical tracking features for entertainment purposes only. All content is for entertainment and discussion purposes only. This is NOT a gambling product, sports betting service, or any service that pays out winnings or facilitates actual betting.</p>

    <h2>2. NOT A GAMBLING SERVICE</h2>
    <p>Picksdb does NOT provide, facilitate, or promote gambling, betting, wagering, or any form of real-money gaming. While we may display odds information and hypothetical tracking features (such as unit calculations) for entertainment purposes, we do NOT pay out any winnings, prizes, or financial returns based on predictions or outcomes. This platform does NOT offer sports betting, fantasy sports for money, or any service where outcomes determine actual financial returns. All odds displays and tracking features are purely for entertainment and discussion purposes only. We do not operate a sportsbook or any gambling-related business. Any hypothetical calculations shown do NOT represent actual money or payouts.</p>

    <h2>3. No Wagering or Prizes</h2>
    <p>We do not operate a sportsbook, fantasy contest, or sweepstakes. Users may not place wagers, pay entry fees for outcomes, or receive prizes based on any predictions or content. Attempts to arrange bets, prize pools, or off-platform wagering through the platform are prohibited and may lead to immediate account removal. We do not facilitate gambling of any kind.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using Picksdb, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you may not use the service.</p>
